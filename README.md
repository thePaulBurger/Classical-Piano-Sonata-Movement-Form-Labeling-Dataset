# Classical Piano Sonata Movement Form Labeling Dataset

This repository contains a CSV dataset of sonata form labels used during my Master's research. It was created to support structural form labelling of Classical piano sonatas and is based on annotations from established musicological sources.

## Contents

- `labels.csv` — The main dataset containing formal structure labels for selected piano sonatas.
- `label_sources.csv` — Documentation of the musicologists and analytical sources used in the labeling process.
- `audio_sources.csv` — Documentation of the audio recordings used.

## Background

The dataset focuses on piano sonatas composed during the Classical period (roughly 1730–1828), a time marked by formal discipline, structural clarity, and unambiguous section boundaries. These characteristics make the period especially well-suited for the study of automatic form recognition.

Each movement in the dataset is labeled according to analyses from published musicological sources (books, monographs, and theses), ensuring academic rigor and consistency. In cases where multiple sources provided different labels for the same movement, all variants are included.

## Composers Included

The dataset includes works by major Classical-era composers such as:

- Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–1791)
- Franz Joseph Haydn (1732–1809)
- Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827)
- Muzio Clementi (1752–1832)
- Carl Czerny (1791 - 1857)

Some works, such as those by Czerny and Clementi, may be considered late-Classical.

## Usage

The dataset is provided in standard CSV format and can be parsed using any common data analysis software (e.g., Python, R, Excel). No special installation is required.
